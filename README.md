# Trivia of the U.S. State Capitals

This application allows you to test your knowledge on state capitals (specifically the U.S. state Capitals). You have **40 seconds** to answer as many questions as you can correctly. In the end, you will receive your score with the number of questions you answer correctly. Give it a try [Here](https://amspears.github.io/Trivia/)

## Technology Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery

## Approach Taken

Before developing the game, I researched other trivia games online to get a user experience and see how to best develop the game. After doing the research, I sketched what I wanted this game to look like and the functionality I wanted to implement follow by writing a pseudocode to guide my process.

## Installation Instructions

Fork and clone the repository to render all the files.

## Future Implementations

 - Display the questions that were correct and incorrect while the user is playing.
 - Display the score on the page rather than using the alert.
 - Creating other Levels to the game.
 - Create other Trivia topics for the User to choose.
